My parents divorced in 2010. It didn‚Äôt affect me alot as I saw my dad on the weekend every other week. Here after 6. Grade you decide between Spez. Sek, Sek and Real.

I could‚Äôve but didn‚Äôt want to. 15/20 went. During Landschulwoche I asked my then best friend ‚ÄûLino‚Äú for his phone, surprisingly he gave it to me. There I saw a WhatsApp Chat ‚ÄûDi√§ Besseri H√§lfti‚Äú (The better half). It was filled with stickers mocking others from the class. It was also used to give around secrets and meetups. Lino said that I could join and they just waited to ask me. In my class were 16 Girls and 4 Boys. All the Boys were in the group,  I shared a 4people Room with them. 
Well guess what I did‚Ä¶
I declined, not wanting to identify with that stuff. So I was shunned, basically from one moment to the next completely disliked by half the class. So I went to the other half and chilled with them. Just me and a bunch of girls. I talked with Lia which was also in the ‚ÄûSchl√§chteri H√§ufti‚Äú (Worse Half) about it. She is also gifted but super introverted. She also knew about the chat by building together clues that she got and heard like: ‚ÄûSend it into the chat, shhh not so loud‚Äú. So we decided to tell the group‚Ä¶ Shocked by what they heard I had them promising to not act on it. I was already unpopular since I declined but knowing that I snitched would‚Äôve destroyed me even more. So we went to the teacher. Stefan Hadorn we told him about it and also that we don‚Äôt wanna talk about it in class. It would only worsen the situation. Well the same evening a girl was so pissed that she confronted the ‚ÄûBesseri H√§lfti‚Äú‚Ä¶. I flipped out, insulting her until she run out crying. Atleast the others understood me, I still had to sleep in a room with 3 boys from the group‚Ä¶
Then the next day which was also the last day, the teacher called us together and said ‚ÄûI heard of a group‚Ä¶‚Äú this mf, we had a deal. So the entire last week of school no one from both halves talked with each other. Making it the worst week in my life until later.

            content: `So going down from the Spez. Sek. To the Sek. Is like a huge downgrade. I was back in a class filled with people that interrupt and can‚Äôt focus. I had perfect grades without learning a single second. I got so bored that I started to think. Maybe think about too much. You know puberty and then the Meaning of Life hits you‚Ä¶ so all I wanted was change in the areas where I could. I wanted justice and fairness.
This was the first time I got good at presentations since I had this narcissistic tone in my head of ‚Äûyou are better than them‚Äú. So I wanted fairness at home. My brother had a bigger room and own bathroom. I had the room besides my mom occasionally hearing her do fun stuff with partners... I had to share my small bathroom with her and her boyfriend. So what I suggested was Bigger Room or Smaller Room and Bathroom. 
This would be fairer right. I didn‚Äôt even care which one. But my mom said ‚ÄûWe are already looking for a new Apartment" this was lie.
So I focused on another issue. A simple ruleset that would remove 90% of conflicts me and my brother had. Rules like:
When something is in the fridge without a name for 4days anyone can take it.
Again my mom refused ‚ÄûWe can live together without laws, we are a family‚Äú. Then another point I had was that I got super bored talking about how my day was emotionally. She never cared what we learned and when I told her we learned this/this. She just said don‚Äôt be so arrogant.
So I got pissed. Bored in school, not knowing why I exist and not being able to fix the smallest flaws. I got mad, I yelled at her every evening. My dad had to come around to calm me since I would lock myself and play music so loud that the neighbors would come and complain
<br><br>
So after many weeks of this she said ‚ÄûIf it is so bad here move to your dad. Everyone else is happy you are the problem.‚Äú Kinda gave me French Revolution Vibes when the 1. , 2. and 3. Stand just got one Vote each.
So I moved to my dad. Completely unhappy since I hated my dads apartment. Its so much dirtier has less food especially healthy food and overall just sucks. So I ignored my mom for 2.5 months then eventually made a Appointment to talk about our stuff again.
We had the appointment, I presented my points, my options and what she would accept. She said no to everything. When I asked for her points or where we could make a deal that works for all parties, she was just silent.
Is this the way you treat someone you ‚Äûcare about deeply‚Äú and when she said I only had demands and everything was illusion and that I was the problem I flipped out once again. The last time for a long period. I went to my brothers room and told her I'd destroy his stuff if we didn‚Äôt find a compromise.
Well after some back and forth I just left. Blocked her everywhere and never again went to family festival events. This lasts even today‚Ä¶<br><br>
Conclusions:<br>
Even people that care, care more about themselves.<br>
People suck at change.<br>
People think time will heal scars.<br>
Family is just forced friendship<br>`,

Mixed with mild-severe depressions I spent alot of time with a Online-Friend. His Name was Carmelo Luzifer Fischer (YoxiQ), we understood each other had the same ideas and both hurt by how people work. We wanted change and change that lasts, we pinpointed the problem to politicians only ruling so that they get voted again, not really to help long term. We thought to ourselves "How can we stop the decay of a system?" and the conclusion was "Immortality". As human not dying could rule forever. When I say this now I know that it's delulu, but back then I really needed this hope. So what we strived for was nothing less than a longer life. Now how could you  afford such a expensive science? Money! So lets look at how people got rich, I mean as a ENTJ we are basically born for leadership. We realized only those who are ready to drop morals, humanity and sanity can consitstently get rich. Sure there are other cases out of pure luck. So I quickly turned from a loving ENFP into a cruel ENTJ not wanting anything to do with morals or emotions. This went on for more than a year, not really happy and only fueled by progress I knew it was time for change. This is the most important phase but I am trying to keep it short. We were super manipulative toxic and league players.`,

Thus the Omni-Phase began. Instead of being this emotionless core just working for progress, I wanted to be normal. I started reading alot again, especially psychology. Wrote stuff myself, about evil, the world and me. Now with Omnism comes a open mind, not being able to accept one rational or irrational opinion as the truth. I didn't really match with my best friend YoxiQ anymore. More and more I saw a homophobe, toxic asshole in him. When his gf left and made him a voice message that he is manipulative and a psycho, that made me think. I compared myself to him and a big parted didn't want to be this anymore. I talked with him, about being less homophobe and everything but all I got was "This is who I am, accept it. You can leave anytime if you want.". Which threw me back to my mom sending me to my dad's home. So I wrote the first ever manifest of Omnism, also searching for people to further my studies and finally get happy. This is where I met Aminia, she later showed me pdb. We are still friends and call from time to time. On pdb I met you and others. Talked about my problems alot, finally got to understand them atleast a bit.`,

But she tries her best, this is why I wanna also get your view. From you to me. Right now I cannot distinguish between love and friendship, since I don't really have anyone that I care about. My emotional connections don't exist. My family, friends from school, work or anywhere could die without me even shedding a tear. I wanna change that, have genuine people that I care about. Find people that are there.

So to list my Problems:<br>
-Omnism (Still trying to figure out who I am) But I am getting closer and I want to be this ENTJ but not to the extremes like I was before more balanced like 75%t and 25%f instead of 98%t.<br>
-Emotional Connections, I still need someone to care about and to be there for.<br>
-Lonelyness, I feel extremly alone especially in my job, surrouned by introverts and rather dumb kids. I should've went to High School<br>
-Morals, I still don't have a big part in guilt and remorse. I apologized to the people I hurt and try to refrain from it.<br>
-Breakdowns, From time to time I have these breakdowns like once a month where I grab my hair and cry and scream. It is my way of letting out all the bad emotions that I can't show in my day to day life.<br>`,
